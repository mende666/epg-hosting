<desc lang="fr-FR">Des contreforts du Massif central aux collines du Sud-Ouest coule l'Aveyron. Ce cours d'eau servait de voie de communication vers Toulouse jusqu'à la Renaissance. Pour protéger cet axe stratégique, de nombreux châteaux ont été édifiés au fil des siècles. Aujourd'hui, des passionnés tentent d'en préserver certains. Axel Letellier, architecte du patrimoine, a racheté la ruine du château de Penne, pour la consolider et l'ouvrir à la visite.</desc>

<title lang="en">Homestead Rescue</title>
<desc lang="en">Idyllic in nature, the concept of living a scaled-down, simpler, off-the-grid life has gained popularity in recent years, but the initial results for many budding homesteaders have been disappointing. The learning curve is steep, especially in the most dangerous and isolated locations across the country. Many families are not equipped with the skills, experience or knowledge of how to grow food, find water, harness power or deal with the threat of predators. In "Homestead Rescue," craftsman and survival expert Marty Raney -- joined by daughter Misty, a farmer, and son Matt, a hunter and fisherman -- attempt to teach these families the essential skills on how to survive -- and thrive -- in the wilderness. Because sustaining a homestead through hunting, fishing, gardening, building upkeep, security, and problem solving is a full-time job. At the conclusion of each episode, the rookie survivalists decide to either tough out their first year or pack up and return to civilization.</desc>

<desc lang="en">An NFL Films production, "NFL Matchup" is definitely a show for football junkies. Unlike traditional football preview programs, this one gives fans an in-depth look at some of Sunday's games by breaking down the strategy and tactics -- the Xs and Os -- through the exclusive use of team-supplied footage. That type of film study is a forte of former NFL player Matt Bowen and NFL Films producer Greg Cosell, whose work is featured here alongside host Sal Paolantonio.</desc>

<desc lang="en">It's been two years since the gang known as the Wolfpack narrowly escaped disaster in Bangkok. Now, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) have happy lives at home -- but Alan (Zach Galifianakis) doesn't. Still lacking contentment and a sense of purpose, Alan has gone off his meds and surrendered to his natural impulses. It's up to the other members of the Wolfpack to get him through his personal crisis by embarking on a road trip to the place it all began: Las Vegas.</desc>
